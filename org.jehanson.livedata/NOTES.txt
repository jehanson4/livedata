Now that LiveData is special class for 'root of a tree', I can put a URI in it.
Is that a good idea or not?

Which users would be screwed up if somebody set the URI?

In LiveModel there's a very close association between URIs and things like LMGraph nodes
so I could make it final.

since uri's can be converted into url's and url's can open streams, a LiveModel with a 
non-null URI can be self-reloading.


But it still feels like I'm mixing concerns that are better left separate. 
(1) in-memory object representation of semi-structured data
(2) association between an object in memory and a URI
